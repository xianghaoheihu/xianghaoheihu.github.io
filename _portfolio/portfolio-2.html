title: "Edge Computing Empowered Tactile Internet for Human Digital Twin in Physical Theraphy"
excerpt: "This platform is mainly aimed at physical therapy applications and is divided into three modules: main domain, network domain, and controlled domain. 
The main control domain provides physical therapists with two operational behaviors (massage and hitting), where tapping is provided through geomatic 
touch and massage is provided through tactile gloves, and transmitted through the network domain to the controlled domain. Within the controlled domain, 
virtual high-fidelity scene modeling is provided, including virtual environments and physical therapy patients. Different operating systems in the main
control domain provide different tactile feedback, which is exciting, The next step is to feed back the obtained tactile data to the human digital twin
system, providing dynamic monitoring of patient data and ensuring safe data for patients.
