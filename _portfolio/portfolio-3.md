title: "Tactile Internet empowers medical servicest"
excerpt: "The platform is divided into three modules for human organ therapy (such as vascular dredging): main domain, network domain, and controlled domain. In the control domain, Unity technology is used to virtualize human blood vessels and other internal organs. The left image shows capillaries and the right image shows the interior of blood vessels. This model is used for real-time detection of human blood vessel changes in digital twins. Secondly, the main domain is a geographic touch terminal operated by humans, while the network domain represents traditional Ethernet USB for network transmission. Edge computing devices are used for resource allocation, including bandwidth, storage, and other benefits. When doctors operate the geomatic touch, they can receive real-time virtual tactile feedback from blood vessels, providing navigation for surgery and vascular dredging (collision detection will be performed when touching the inside of the blood vessels, providing hardness feedback). The tactile feedback of this collision detection is exciting. When users navigate in real-time, it can detect whether the inner wall of blood vessels is blocked, and it can be unblocked, providing navigation effects for blood vessel routes, and can be promoted to other topics related to human health.<br/><img src='/images/treatment.png'>"
