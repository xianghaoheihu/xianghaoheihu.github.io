About Me
======
I am an autumn doctoral student in Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China. I am honored to have received an offer to join [Professor Yi](https://www.smilinnet.com/changyan/)'s SmilinNet (Intelligent Mobile Innovation Networking) research group. My research focuses on **Tactile Internet** and edge intelligence (see our recent [magazine paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769555?source=authoralert). This involves exploring the integration of **network technologies** including multi-objective optimization, network optimization, and human digital twins. The Tactile Internet represents a disruptive networking paradigm with transformative potential across human activities – from healthcare (particularly physical therapy) to manufacturing. Our research specifically investigates human-in-the-loop interaction systems, integrating digital twins, cyber-physical systems, large language models (LLMs), and edge intelligence. More relevant information can be found in our magazine documents. **If you’re interested in collaboration or discussion, please reach out via email or WeChat**. I look forward to meaningful dialogue and exploring new opportunities – where there’s a will, there’s a way to achieve extraordinary outcomes together.
