excerpt: 'Due to the heterogeneity of big data cloud platform and the uneven distribution of data between cloud servers, when cloud server cluster processes a large number of tasks, the node load is often uneven. To solve this problem, a load balancing algorithm based on improved chaotic partition algorithm for big data cloud platform server is proposed. According to the statistics of the average resource consumption of various services provided by the cluster, combined with the running time and resource occupation of tasks on the server, the total remaining task load of the server at a certain time point is predicted, so as to obtain the actual task load status of the node, and correct the task load in time. Experiments show that the load balancing algorithm of big data cloud platform server based on improved chaotic partition algorithm can effectively balance the load of multi task heterogeneous cloud servers, and has high feasibility, Then, based on this improved load balancing algorithm, we can also extend it to the application of multi-objective algorithm, such as robot path planning, target allocation scheduling algorithm and so on. There will be similar and reasonable performance compared with the same period last year.'
